## [[0.0.2.0]](https://github.com/mod-posh/NewTaggedRelease/releases/tag/v0.0.2.0) - 2024-01-10

This is a breaking change. This release moves from Python to PowerShell for ease of troubleshooting on my end. This release has removed the calculation of the version from the project file. This can be passed either by another action, or script, or manually if need be.

What's Changed

1. Changed the Action to PowerShell
2. Removed Version calculation
3. Added Name and Version inputs
4. Added Verbose for more detailed logging
